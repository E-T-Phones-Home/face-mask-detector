## The Problem
**187 million**: the number of COVID-19 cases thus far. 
**4.03 million**: the appalling worldwide death toll due to COVID-19. 
Social distancing and mask-wearing mandates have slackened. When going out for groceries, we observe more and more people ditching their masks because they've "gotten the vaccines already" or because they have "the right to breathe". However, what they don't see are the daunting numbers of people who end up hospitalized, even after getting their vaccines. Furthermore, masks protect everybody from all kinds of airborne diseases, including the common cold, chickenpox, measles, tuberculosis, and pneumonia. 

## What MaskUp does
MaskUp is a web app designed to help prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus and collect COVID-19 data. MaskUp could be used in public spaces worldwide to only allow entry to those who are wearing face masks. For example, the success message could set off a trigger, allowing a door to open. 

## Key features
+ Continuous webcam feed, with a message displaying whether or not the user is wearing a mask. This results in either a success or failure message. 
+ Group mask detection. An image that is uploaded will be output with boxes around the people that do not have masks on. 
+ Each time a user uses this app, the computer will store the result in a database, and on a statistics page, it can show the percentage
